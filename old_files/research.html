        I'm interested in symplectic geometry, in particular Fukaya categories and
        quilted Floer theory.  My current research revolves around building composition
        operations amongst Fukaya categories of different symplectic manifolds.
        I use polyfolds in my research, though I'm not a developer of that theory.
        All the papers I've written since I started grad school are available at
        <a href="http://arxiv.org/a/bottman_n_1">the arXiv</a>.

            <p>We establish a Gromov compactness theorem for strip shrinking in
            pseudoholomorphic quilts when composition of Lagrangian correspondences
            is immersed.
			   In particular, we show that figure eight bubbling occurs in the limit, argue
			   that this is a codimension-0 effect, and predict its algebraic consequences
			   &mdash; geometric composition extends to a curved
			   <em>A</em><sub>&infin;</sub>-bifunctor, in particular the associated
				Floer complexes are isomorphic after a figure eight correction of the bounding
				cochain. An appendix with Felix Schm&auml;schke provides examples of
				nontrivial figure eight bubbles.

            <p>We show that the novel figure eight singularity in a pseudoholomorphic quilt
            can be continuously removed when composition of Lagrangian correspondences
            is cleanly immersed. The proof of this result requires a collection of
            width-independent elliptic estimates that allow for non-standard complex
            structures on the domain.</p>

            <p>The stability of the stationary periodic solutions of the integrable
            (one-dimensional, cubic) defocusing nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation
            is reasonably well understood, especially for solutions of small amplitude.
            In this paper, we exploit the integrability of the NLS equation to establish
            the spectral stability of all such stationary solutions, this time by explicitly
				computing the spectrum and the corresponding eigenfunctions associated
				with their linear stability problem. An additional argument using an
				appropriate Krein signature allows us to conclude the (nonlinear) orbital
				stability of all stationary solutions of the defocusing NLS equation with
				respect to so-called subharmonic perturbations: perturbations that have
				period equal to an integer multiple of the period of the amplitude of the
				solution. All results presented here are independent of the size of the
				amplitude of the solutions and apply equally to solutions with trivial and
				nontrivial phase profiles.</p>

            <p>Going back to considerations of Benjamin (1974), there has been
				significant interest in the question of stability for the stationary periodic
				solutions of the Korteweg&ndash;deVries equation, the so-called cnoidal waves.
				In this paper, we exploit the squared-eigenfunction connection between
				the linear stability problem and the Lax pair for the Korteweg&ndash;deVries
				equation to completely determine the spectrum of the linear stability
				problem for perturbations that are bounded on the real line. We find that
				this spectrum is confined to the imaginary axis, leading to the conclusion
				of spectral stability. An additional argument allows us to conclude the
				completeness of the associated eigenfunctions.</p>
